init_pull: 0

reporting:
  # send notifications to slack (requires SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL env variable)
  slack: false

  # send article summaries to stdout in markdown format
  stdout: true

llm:
  # LLM client to use. Possible values: openai / ollama
  client: "openai"

  classification:
    # classification engine to use. Possible values: llm / embeddings.
    engine: "llm"

    # model name that will be used for initial classification.
    # if the engine is llm, the model name should be an LLM model (gpt-like).
    # if the engine is embeddings, the model name should be an embeddings model (e.g., text-embedding-3-small/text-embedding-3-large).
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"

    # articles with a score above this threshold will be classified as relevant.
    # values range from 0 to 10.
    # if the engine is llm-based, 7-8 is a good threshold for relevance in most cases
    # if the engine is embeddings-based, 4-5 is a good threshold (still work-in-progress)
    threshold: 8
  summary:
    # model name that will be used for summarization.
    model: "gpt-4o"

categories:
  # Adding description is optional, but is very beneficial for the LLM model.
  # Description should explain what the user is looking for in the article.
