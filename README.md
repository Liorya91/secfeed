# SecFeed

## TODOS:

### Important:

- Checking minimal article content that fits as an article
- README
- Amortized cost
- write logs to some file, so could investigate classification issues

### Nice to have:

- Reddit feed.
- Linkedin feed.
- Following article that just fowards to a URL (like in reddit?)
- Add option to choose between LLM filtering and embedding filtering
- Add tl;dr sec to feeds?
- Caching
- Ability to bypass Cloudflare when fetching URLs - needed for some feeds.
- Check more feeds:
  - security boulevard
  - bank info security
  - information week
  - infosecurity magazine
  - computerweekly
  - hackread
- Enforce JSON formatting in llm clients
- Embedding
  - generate similar words for improving the precision
