# SecFeed

TODOS:

Important:

- Do a shorter summary
- Checking minimal article content that fits as an article
- Extract article from URLs, when go-readability fails.

Nice to have:

- Reddit feed.
- Linkedin feed.
- Following article that just fowards to a URL (like in reddit?)
- Add option to choose between LLM filtering and embedding filtering
- Add tl;dr sec to feeds?
- Caching
- Ability to bypass Cloudflare when fetching URLs
